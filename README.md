### Description:

* The overall rolling 7-day average for the last 30 days is 14.85%.
* The positive average rate for the 7-day rolling average in the previous month was 19.85%, whereas for the last 30 days, it has been 14.85%.
* The data indicates a significant 5% decrease in positive cases.
* Based on accurate trends and patterns, we can predict and forecast for the next 30 days in the near future.

### Description:

* Based on the analysis of the top 10 highest positive rates, the city with the highest percentage has a rate of 42%.
* The top 10 highest positive rates are significantly higher than the 7-day rolling average, which is currently at 14%.
* It is recommended to focus more on the states with the highest positive rates to reduce the number of cases and take necessary actions. 
* Monitoring the 7-day rolling average can provide valuable insights into the trend of positive cases over time and can aid in identifying areas that require immediate     attention.
